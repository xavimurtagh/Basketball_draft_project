My Basketball Draft Project

*What does it do?
Tells users how good it expects players in college to be and where it ranks them in that draft class.

*How does it do it?
1. Scores players performance in the NBA.
2. Correlates that data with their statistics playing college basketball.
3. Crunches these numbers using a machine learning algorithm to find the statistics it deems to be the best in each position.
4. 

This is a project which analyses player performance in the NBA and in college that tries to find the best college prospects and put them in an order for where the algorithm thinks they are ranked in that years draft.

Why just college and not international
Any problems
