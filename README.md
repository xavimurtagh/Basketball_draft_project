My Basketball Draft Project

* What does it do?
Tells users how good it expects players in college to be and where it ranks them in that draft class.

* How does it do it?
1. Scores players performance in the NBA.
2. Correlates that data with their statistics playing college basketball.
3. Crunches these numbers using a machine learning algorithm to find the statistics it deems to be the most important in each position.
4. Applies the algorithm on the college players to predict how good they are.

*Why just college and not international?
The reason I did this was because the rules are different in other leagues and the level is different in each of these leagues so it would skew my predictions.

Any questions please ask.
